// Does the following code produce an error? Why or why not? What output does it send to the console?

for (let i = 0; i < 5;) {
  console.log(i += 1);
}

// The following code will not produce an error, it will output the numbers 1 to 5 to the console. 1 on the first iteration of the for loop, and 5 on the last iteration of the for loop.

// Even if there is no increment expression inside the parentheses of the loop, the increment expression is located inside the body of the loop itself, on line 4 => i += 1

// The for loop initializes a local variable i to the value 0, then checks if the variable is less than 5. If it is, the body of the for loop will be executed.

// On the first iteration, i has the value 0, which then gets incremented to 1 inside the body of the loop on line 4. The return value of the increment operation (1) is returned and output to the console.

// On the second iteration, i has the value of 1, which then gets incremented to 2 inside the body of the loop on line 4. The return value of the increment operation (2) is returned and output to the console.

// On the fifth iteration, i has the value 4, which then gets incremented to 5 inside the body of the loop on line 4. The return value of the increment operation (5) is returned and output to the console.

// At this point, the conditional expression i < 5 will return false since i has the value of 5 and the loop will terminate.
