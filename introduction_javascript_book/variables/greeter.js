// Write a program named greeter.js
// The program greets "Victor" three times
// Your program should use a variable and not hard code the string Victor in each greeting

let firstName = "Victor";

console.log(`Good Morning, ${firstName}.`);
console.log(`Good Afternoon, ${firstName}.`);
console.log(`Good Evening, ${firstName}.`);

// Another solution is to use string concatenation instead of template literals. So, you would write console.log("Good Morning, " + firstName + ".");
